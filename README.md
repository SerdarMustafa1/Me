A simple version of the popular Die, Pig game. 

Instructions: 

The objective of Pig Dice Game is to score the selected number of points before your opponent does. The Pig game is played with a single six-sided die.

In each turn a player rolls a die repeatedly until either a 1 is rolled or player decides to hold and pass on the turn to its opponent. 
                    
The number player rolls is added to a temporary score. If the player rolls a 1, they lose their temporary score and turn is passed to their opponent.
                    
If player gets any other number, they can decide to continue and roll the die.
                    
If player decides to hold, then their turn total (temporary score) is added to the overall score. 
              
The first player to score 100 points wins the game.
